    Returns the symbols that matter for `task`, their source read from disk, and
    what memory records about them. Prefer this over a bare symbol search when
    the question is "how does X work", "where is X handled", or "what would
    changing X affect".

    Ranking is personalised PageRank over the call graph seeded from the task,
    so results are central *to this task* rather than globally popular or merely
    matching its words. A lexical search answers "which symbols mention these
    words", which is a different question.

    Edge weight combines the engine's confidence with how each hop resolved:
    confidence alone does not separate them, because the LSP and heuristic
    ranges overlap, and a heuristic name match can bind across module
    boundaries. Unresolved hops are dropped rather than carried as weak
    evidence.

    before acting on any of it, so streaming to an agent adds framing and buys
    nothing; this exists for the Console, where seconds of blank screen read as
    a hung page rather than a slow one. The tool keeps returning a single JSON
    body.

    The first event is `context`, the composition the answer is written from,
    so a client renders the evidence and the answer from one retrieval.

    A sync generator on purpose: Starlette iterates it in a worker thread, the
    llama.cpp client is blocking, and the composition it does first is
    `asyncio.run` over a coroutine -- all of which are correct off the event
    loop and wrong on it.
