    Propose durable memories from raw conversation, resolved against the store.

    Pass a transcript as `text` and this returns the sentences in it that read
    like durable facts, each already checked against what is stored: `new`
    (nothing close), `duplicate` (already recorded), or `near` (close to
    something stored -- worth your judgement, because an encoder cannot tell
    "refines it" from "contradicts it").

    With `use_llm=True`, once the operator has enabled local generation, it
    composes a self-contained fact, and every generated proposal cites a
    VERBATIM span from the transcript, checked against the source before it is
    offered.

    By default, and whenever no model is enabled and reachable, it SELECTS
    sentences: a fact spread over three turns, or implied but never said
    plainly, will not be proposed.

    By default NOTHING IS WRITTEN BY `propose`. Proposals are staged for
    review, and only `apply` writes one -- the same contract as
    marm_compaction, for the same reason: a similarity score is not evidence
    enough to change memory unattended. The one exception is
    review_mode="guardrails" with auto-apply switched on, where `propose`
    also applies each proposal that passes every deterministic check.

    Parameters:
    - action: propose | review | apply | discard (default propose)
    - text: the conversation to distil (required for propose)
    - session_name: session the proposals belong to (required for propose;
      optional filter for review)
    - proposal_id: which proposal to act on (required for apply/discard)
    - project: scope name recorded on the memory that `apply` writes
    - context_type: memory context type for the write (default general)
    - threshold: shape-score floor, default 0.20. Excludes chatter and little
      else; measured against the live store, a higher floor discards real
      memories long before it meaningfully reduces the count
    - limit: most proposals to return (default 20). THIS is the volume control
    - include_duplicates: also stage what the store already holds (default off,
      because a queue of known facts does not get read)
    - use_llm: write facts with the local model (default off; needs the
      operator to have enabled generation, and falls back to selection)
    - review_mode: "manual" (default) stages everything for review;
      "guardrails" also applies a proposal that passes every deterministic
      check, only when the operator has switched auto-apply on

    Returns: status plus `proposals` (propose) or `pending` (review), each
    carrying content, score, the reasons it scored, verdict, cosine, and the
    neighbouring memory when there is one.
