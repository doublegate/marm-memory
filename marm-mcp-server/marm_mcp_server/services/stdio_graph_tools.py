    🧩 Composed code context for a task: ranked symbols + source + memory, in ONE call.

    Prefer this over marm_code_lookup when the question is "how does X work",
    "where is X handled", or "what would changing X affect" -- it answers with
    the symbols that matter, their source read from disk, and what memory
    records about them, instead of leaving you to fetch each part yourself.

    Ranking is personalised PageRank over the call graph seeded from `task`, so
    a result is central *to this task* rather than globally popular or merely
    word-matching. Read `markdown` and stop; the structured fields are the same
    content for programmatic callers.

    Parameters:
    - task: what you are trying to do or understand
    - project: code-graph project name or repo path; omit to resolve from cwd
    - cwd: directory to resolve the project from (optional)
    - budget: character budget for the returned source, 500-100000 (default 12000)
    - include_graph: also return the ranked call neighbourhood as `graph_edges`;
      off by default because it is several KB of JSON only a visualiser reads
    - answer: also answer the task from the composed context with a local
      model, citing the symbols it used. Off by default -- it is the slow step,
      and for an agent that reads code the ranked context IS the answer.
      The operator's analyst profile bounds it. `answer_status` is "ok" when
      every result is verified against the composed context, "unverified"
      when support is incomplete, "rejected" when it cites something the
      context does not contain (`answer_unresolved` names it);
      "unavailable" rather than a failure when generation is off or no model
      is up
    - analyst_mode: with `answer`, "read_only" (default) returns the verified
      answer only; "manual_review" also stages its verified results as
      marm_distill proposals for approval; "guardrails" lets MARM apply the
      ones it can prove mechanically, only where the operator set
      MARM_ANALYST_AUTO_APPLY=1. The model never applies anything
    - detail: how much to return. 1 is markdown only and is the default,
      because `markdown` already contains the source and the memory text --
      asking for 3 means paying for the same bytes twice. 2 adds symbol and
      memory metadata without repeating bodies; 3 adds them. 0 means "use the
      server default" (MARM_CODE_CONTEXT_DETAIL)

    Returns: status, project, markdown, symbols, memories, links, graph_nodes,
    notes -- or a no_project/unavailable status carrying the next step to take.
    Each symbol carries `label` (the code KIND) and, when it arrived through the
    call graph rather than by matching the task, a `provenance` object with hop,
    strategy, confidence and risk; `provenance` is null for a seeded symbol
